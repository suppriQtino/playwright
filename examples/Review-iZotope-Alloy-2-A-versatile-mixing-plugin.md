It also has a comprehensive preset system that lets you choose from over 250 presets for different instruments, genres and styles. You can also create your own presets and save them for future use.
 
Here are some of the main features of each tool in Alloy 2:
 
- **Equalizer**: A six-band parametric EQ with eight filter types, spectrum analyzer, gain reduction meter and mid/side mode. You can use it to shape the tone and balance of your tracks, as well as to remove unwanted frequencies and enhance desired ones.
- **Dynamics**: A multiband compressor/expander/gate with four bands, sidechain input, adaptive release mode and vintage mode. You can use it to control the dynamics and loudness of your tracks, as well as to add punch, warmth or smoothness.
- **Exciter**: A multiband harmonic enhancer with four bands, three saturation modes (tube, tape and retro) and a blend control. You can use it to add richness, brightness and character to your tracks, as well as to create subtle or extreme distortion effects.
- **De-Esser**: A single-band de-esser with adjustable frequency, threshold and reduction controls. You can use it to reduce or eliminate sibilance and harshness from vocals or other high-frequency sources.
- **Transient Shaper**: A multiband transient shaper with four bands, attack and sustain controls and a global shape control. You can use it to adjust the transient response of your tracks, as well as to enhance or soften the impact of drums, guitars or other percussive sources.
