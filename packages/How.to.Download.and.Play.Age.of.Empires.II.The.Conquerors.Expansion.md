Now that you have downloaded and installed Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion, you may be wondering how to play it well. Whether you are a beginner or a veteran, there are always some tips and tricks that can help you improve your skills and strategies. Here are some of them:

- **Learn the basics.** Before you jump into a game, make sure you know the basics of the game mechanics, such as how to gather resources, build structures, train units, research technologies, and fight enemies. You can play the tutorial campaign or watch some videos online to get familiar with the game.
- **Choose your civilization wisely.** Each of the 18 civilizations in the game has its own unique strengths, weaknesses, bonuses, and special units. Some are better suited for certain maps, game modes, or strategies than others. For example, the Aztecs have a strong infantry and monks, but no cavalry or gunpowder units. The Spanish have a powerful navy and gunpowder units, but lack archers and siege weapons. The Huns have a fast and aggressive playstyle, but no stone walls or houses. You should choose a civilization that matches your preference and situation.
- **Manage your economy efficiently.** One of the most important aspects of the game is managing your economy. You need to balance your resource income and expenditure, and avoid having too much or too little of any resource. You also need to keep your villagers busy and productive at all times, and avoid having idle time or wasted resources. You should also try to secure more resources on the map by expanding your base, building outposts, and controlling key areas.
- **Use housing as a cheap wall.** Houses don't cost very much, so they can work as an effective defensive wall at the start of the game. Make sure to place them side by side so there's no gap between them. You can also use other buildings like barracks, markets, or town centers to create a wall around your base. This will help you protect your villagers and resources from enemy raids and invasions.
- **Scout your surroundings.** Scouting is essential for gathering information about your enemy and the map. You should use your scout cavalry or other fast units to explore the map as soon as possible. You should try to find your enemy's base, their resources, their military buildings, and their army composition. You should also look for extra resources, relics, neutral buildings, choke points, hills, and other features that can give you an advantage or disadvantage in the game.

These are just some of the tips that can help you play Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion better. There are many more things to learn and master in this complex and rewarding game. The best way to improve is to practice regularly, watch replays of other players, and learn from your mistakes. Remember to have fun and enjoy this timeless classic!
