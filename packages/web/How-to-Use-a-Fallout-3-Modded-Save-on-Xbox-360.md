Fallout 3 is a popular post-apocalyptic role-playing game that was released in 2008 for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game allows players to explore a vast open world, complete quests, collect items, craft weapons and armor, and customize their character. However, some players may want to use a modded save file that gives them access to all the items, perks, skills, and locations in the game without having to play through it normally. A modded save file is a file that has been altered by another player using a program or a device that can edit the game data.

There are many modded save files available online for Fallout 3, but not all of them are compatible with the Xbox 360 version. Some of them may require additional software or hardware to use, such as a modded console, a transfer cable, or a USB flash drive. Some of them may also cause glitches, errors, or crashes in the game. Therefore, it is important to be careful when choosing and using a modded save file for Fallout 3 on Xbox 360.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use a Fallout 3 modded save file on Xbox 360 that does not require any additional equipment or software. This save file is called **Ultimate Fallout 3 Save** and it was created by Simplywhite and uploaded on Nexus Mods[^1^]. This save file gives you every possible item in the game, including some unique weapons that are normally not playable. It also lets you start with the nuke ready to blow in Megaton, which is one of the major choices in the game. The save file also includes all the DLCs for Fallout 3: Broken Steel, Mothership Zeta, Operation: Anchorage, Point Lookout, and The Pitt.
 
To use this save file, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the save file from Nexus Mods[^1^] and extract it to your computer. You will get a file named *Save 1 - Vault Dweller Vault 101 Entrance*.
2. Plug in your USB flash drive to your computer and format it as FAT32 if it is not already.
3. Copy your original Fallout 3 save file from your Xbox 360 hard drive or memory unit to your USB flash drive using the Xbox 360 dashboard. You can find your save file under *Games > Fallout 3 > Saved Games*. Make sure you back up your original save file somewhere else in case you want to restore it later.
4. Plug in your USB flash drive to your computer again and open it. You will see a folder named *Xbox360*. Inside it, you will see another folder named *Data*. Inside that folder, you will see several folders with random numbers and letters. These are your Xbox 360 profiles. Find the folder that matches your profile ID. You can check your profile ID by going to *Settings > Account > Account Security > Show on Home* on your Xbox 360 dashboard.
5. Open the folder that matches your profile ID and you will see another folder named *FalloutNV*. This is where your Fallout 3 save files are stored. Rename the original save file that you copied earlier to something else, such as *Save1.bak*. Then copy the modded save file that you downloaded earlier and paste it into the same folder. Rename it to match the original save file name, such as *Save1.dat*.
6. Eject your USB flash drive from your computer and plug it into your Xbox 360. Start Fallout 3 and load the modded save file from your USB flash drive. You should see a message saying *Loading content...*. Wait for it to finish loading and then enjoy your modded game!

Note: If you want to change your character's appearance or name when you leave the vault, you can do so by selecting *Edit Character*. However, do not touch the stats or skills as it will mess them up.
