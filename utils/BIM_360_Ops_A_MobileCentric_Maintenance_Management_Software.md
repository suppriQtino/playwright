BIM 360 Ops is not only a software product, but also a collaborative platform for building operations. It allows you to connect with your team members, vendors, and contractors, and share important information and updates. You can also assign and track work tickets, monitor asset performance, and generate reports and insights. BIM 360 Ops helps you improve communication, coordination, and productivity among your building stakeholders.
 
One of the main advantages of BIM 360 Ops is that it leverages the power of BIM (Building Information Modeling) to provide you with accurate and detailed asset data. BIM is a process that creates and manages digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of buildings. BIM 360 Ops allows you to import asset data from Revit or BIM 360 Build, or even from a spreadsheet, and link it to your building floor plans. This way, you can access all the relevant information about your assets, such as location, model, serial number, warranty, O&M manuals, and 3D models. You can also update asset information on your mobile devices as you perform maintenance tasks.
 
BIM 360 Ops is designed to be easy to use and mobile-centric. You can access the software from any device with an internet connection, and use the intuitive interface to manage your building operations. You can also use the offline mode to work without internet access, and sync your data when you reconnect. BIM 360 Ops supports voice-to-text conversion to speed up data entry, and barcode scanning to quickly identify assets. You can also use the indoor maps feature to locate tickets and assets, do wayfinding for technicians, and enable more effective ticket triaging and analysis.
 
BIM 360 Ops is a powerful and flexible software that can adapt to your specific needs and preferences. You can customize your dashboard, ticket categories, asset types, roles and permissions, notifications, and reports. You can also integrate BIM 360 Ops with other software applications and systems using the API (Application Programming Interface). For example, you can integrate BIM 360 Ops with your building automation systems and IoT devices to send alarms to the software and track resolution. You can also integrate BIM 360 Ops with other Autodesk products such as AutoCAD or Fusion 360.
 
BIM 360 Ops is a smart investment for building owners and operators who want to optimize their building performance and reduce their operational costs. By using BIM 360 Ops, you can:

- Deliver a better handover experience from construction to operations
- Ensure compliance with warranty requirements and preventive maintenance schedules
